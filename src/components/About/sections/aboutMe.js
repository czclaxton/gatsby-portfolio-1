        <p>
          Ahoy ðŸ‘‹, there. I'm a full stack web developer. An irrationalist at
          heart. I believe in the sudden burst of inspiration or intuition to
          solve a problem.

          I started with HTML, then CSS and JavaScript. Later with some
          difficultly moved on to completing Team TreeHouse's 80 hour front-end
          development course, as well as many YouTube and Udemy courses. I
          couldn't get enough, I was hooked.

          Late August 2019, I joined Lambda School's 9 month coding school, and
          learned valuable skills such as React, Node.js, SQL, Python and C.
          Most importantly, I learned how to work efficiently.

          I am currently looking to join a team where I can contribute some fun
          sophisticated code. I keep myself ticking by learning Vietnamese
          language, and working on my personal side project you can check out my
          github for it, and generating content for my blog.
