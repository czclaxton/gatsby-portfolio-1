        <p>
          Ahoy ðŸ‘‹, there. With nearly 4 years of web development experience
          under my belt, I have enjoyed working with React, Redux, Node/Express
          and PostgresSQL and making applications optimize.

        <p>
          I started with HTML, then CSS and JavaScript. I later moved on
          to Team TreeHouse's 80 hour front-end development course, as well as
          many YouTube and Udemy courses. I couldn't get enough, I was hooked.

          I started Lambda School's 9 month coding school in late August 2018,
          and learned valuable skills such as React, Node.js, SQL, Python and C.
          Most importantly, I learned how to work efficiently.
        </p>

          I am currently looking to join a team where I can contribute some fun
          sophisticated code. I keep myself ticking by learning Vietnamese
          language, and working on my personal side project thinklikeahorse.
